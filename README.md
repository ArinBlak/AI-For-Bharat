# 🇮🇳 Yojana-Setu: Phygital AI Caseworker

Yojana-Setu is a state-of-the-art **Phygital (Physical + Digital)** AI platform designed to bridge the gap between complex government schemes and rural Indian citizens. Leveraging advanced LLMs, Voice-to-Voice agents, and automated robotic process automation (RPA), it simplifies scheme discovery and application filing.

### Core Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (Glassmorphism UI).
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), Uvicorn.
- **AI/LLMs**: 
  - **Sarvam AI**: For `sarvam-30b` reasoning and high-fidelity Indic TTS/STT.
  - **Llama 3.3 (Groq)**: For real-time voice agent orchestration.
- **RAG Engine**: Pinecone Vector DB with `SentenceTransformer` (bi-encoder) and `Cross-Encoder` reranking.
- **Database**: AWS DynamoDB (User Profiles & Chat Sessions).
- **Validation**: Sarvam Document Intelligence for OCR-based ID verification.

##  Future Roadmap: Scaling & Implementation

### 1. Unified Scheme Hub (Scaling Strategy)
The platform is designed for **exponential scaling**. Our goal is to integrate all major Indian welfare schemes:
- **Health**: Ayushman Bharat (PM-JAY) e-card generation.
- **Education**: PM-SHRI and scholarship automated tracking.
- **Farmer Support**: Expanded KCC (Kisan Credit Card) and fertilizer subsidy automation.
- **Pension**: Atal Pension Yojana (APY) eligibility and registration.

> [!TIP]
> **Scheme registry scaling:** We will implement a `scheme-config` microservice where adding a new government scheme requires zero code changes—just a schema definition for the portal fields.

### 2. Enhanced Scheme Support
- **PMAY-G & PMAY-U**: Advanced eligibility checking using geo-tagging and income verification APIs.
- **Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)**: Direct integration with e-KYC modules for instant account opening.

### 3. Pros & Automation Benefits
- **Zero Jargon**: AI converts complex legal policy text into simple, spoken local dialects.
- **Automation Efficiency**: Reduces manual form-filling time from 30 minutes to <2 minutes.
- **Self-Correction**: AI-driven validation catches errors in IDs *before* they hit the government portal, reducing rejection rates.

### 3. Advanced Multilingual Support
- Expansion to all 22 scheduled languages of India using Sarvam's unified Indic model.
- Dialect-specific speech recognition (e.g., Bhojpuri-inflected Hindi).
